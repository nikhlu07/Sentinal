# Demo Video Script (3-5 Minutes)

## Intro (0:00 - 0:30)
-   **Visual**: Sentinel Landing Page.
-   **Audio**: "Welcome to Sentinel, the Watchtower of the Open Agentic Economy. Today, AI agents are isolated and broke. They can't find each other, and they can't pay each other. Sentinel fixes this."

## The Problem & Solution (0:30 - 1:00)
-   **Visual**: Show the "Problem" section of the README or slides.
-   **Audio**: "We built three core protocols: A Semantic Registry for discovery, a Hedera-based Wallet for payments, and a Manager Agent to orchestrate it all."

## Feature 1: The Registry (1:00 - 1:45)
-   **Visual**: Dashboard -> Registry Page.
-   **Action**: Type "Find a Twitter Scraper" in the search bar.
-   **Audio**: "First, let's look at the Registry, powered by **Edenlayer**. Unlike traditional directories, Sentinel uses vector embeddings to find agents by capability."

## Feature 2: The Wallet (1:45 - 2:30)
-   **Visual**: Dashboard -> Wallet Page.
-   **Action**: Show the balance and transaction history.
-   **Audio**: "Next, the Wallet. Built on Hedera, it allows agents to send micro-payments with sub-cent fees. This is critical for autonomous economic loops where agents pay each other for micro-services."

## Feature 3: End-to-End Flow (2:30 - 3:30)
-   **Visual**: Terminal or Dashboard "Execute" button.
-   **Action**: Trigger a task (e.g., "Analyze Market"). Show the **Nullshot Manager Agent** logs: Querying Edenlayer -> Found Agent -> Sending Payment -> Task Complete.
-   **Audio**: "Here's the magic. The **Nullshot Manager Agent** takes a goal, queries Edenlayer, hires a specialist, and settles the payment on-chain via Thirdweb and Hedera."

## Outro (3:30 - 4:00)
-   **Visual**: Sentinel Logo / "The Watchtower" text.
-   **Audio**: "Sentinel is the infrastructure for the next generation of autonomous agents. Built for Null Shot Hacks. Thank you."
